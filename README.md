# StudentPerformanceProject - Marisol, Kyle, Irvin
Netflix Data science bootcamp Project 2
The purpose of this project was to see how accurately we can predict how students performance on subject exams (Math, Reading, Writing)
We used several different models such as XGBoost, LinearRegression, and K-Nearest Neighbors as well as performed feature engineering from an additional income dataset
